Hi, this is the technical interview. I'll ask you to implement one more feature in the current repository. Now I'll show you how to set it up.

We will use the local branch. This contains a few things: backend code, frontend code, and docker code. We use docker to ensure reproducibility and ease deployment. If you don't have docker installed, go and install it, it's useful!

I use vscode, feel free to use the editor you like. The code on `try_dev.sh` is how we build the project and launch it locally. The main issue is that we are lacking some components: artificial neural network weights and some images. Follow the instructions on the readme to download the weights.
